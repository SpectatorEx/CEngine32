# CEngine32
A simple library for working with the **Windows** terminal using **Win32**.\
Use <code>#include "cengine32.h"</code> to include all header files of the library.

For convenience, you can compile it into a dynamic or static library. 
To create a dynamic library, you will need to make some edits, just mark each function for export. - [Exporting from a DLL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/exporting-from-a-dll-using-declspec-dllexport?view=msvc-170).
